# Wizard's Matching Game

The Wizard's matching game is a Harry Potter themed memory game. There are 8 pairs of cards on a deck arranged randomly and face down. The purpose of the game is for a player to find all 8 matches by flipping two cards at a time. A demo is available [here](https://zuli89.github.io/memory-game/).

### Game Play
The game starts with all cards face down. During each turn:
* Two cards are clicked and flipped
* If the cards are a match, the cards stay face up 
* If the cards are not a match, they are flipped back to the original position.

Once all cards are matched the player wins the game

### Additional features

* **Timer**: When the first card is flipped a timer starts counting up
* **Move count**: Every time a player selects two cards, it will be counted as a move. A move counter will be shown in the upper left corner of the page.
* **Restart game**: An arrow wil shuffle the cards and start a new game.
* **Rating**: Three lightning bolts are used to rate how well a player did in the game. If it takes the player less than 13 moves to complete the game, the player gets 3 bolts. If it took the player between 13 and 17 moves to complete the game, the player gets 2 bolts. It it takes the player 18 or more moves to complete the game, the player gets one bolt. 

Once a player wins the game, a window will appear providing the rating, total time, move count it took the player to finish the game.
